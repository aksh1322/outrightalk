*Prerequisites*

Node.js (for the React frontend)
npm (for package management)
yarn (for package management)
Docker (for containerization)
docker-compose (for container orchestration)

PHP (for the Laravel backend)

Composer (for managing PHP dependencies)

MySQL (or another database supported by Laravel)

*Installation*

**Laravel Backend**
Navigate to the laravel-backend directory:
- cd laravel-backend

* Install PHP dependencies:
- composer install

* Set up the environment variables by copying the .env.example file to .env and configure your database connection:
- cp .env.example .env

* Generate the application key:
- php artisan key:generate

* Run the migrations to set up the database:
php artisan migrate

* Start the Laravel development server:
php artisan serve

**React Frontend**
* Navigate to the out-react-web directory:
- cd out-react-web

* Install Node.js dependencies:
- npm install

* Start the React development server:
- npm start
- npm run start:react

*Usage*

Ensure both the Laravel backend and React frontend servers are running.
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the React application.
The React application communicates with the Laravel backend, which handles API requests.
